    * Before I start with pros and cons on tree trevarsal. Weather to use recursion or not actually evolves from the notion of what
    * data structure modeling we are dealing with. Here more specifically recursive ADT's. If it is recursive ADT, automatically 
    * recursive code fits with the solution. If the modeling is not recursive obviously it drives the imparative/iterative solution.
    * Credits: https://htdp.org/ how to design programs :-)
    * 
    * Tree traversal:
    *   Recursive:
    *     1. approach is really simple, declarative and readable, 
    *     2. but obviusly there is a catch you might not want to blow up your stack for really huge recursion, or wrongly implemented solution.  
    *     3. That is where `Trempolining` comes into picture. It's like saying move the recursion to heap rather than stack. 
    *     4. Now this is specific to JVM. Also with new project loom merging in to jdk, which will support tail call elemination, recusions will be well supported by Java platform.
    * 
    * But with current versions of Java, we can always go for tempolining using scala3 TailCall 
    * functions or in scala2 implementing our own Trempolining with Free Monads.
    *
    *   Iterative:
    *     1. approach is also good but it has too many moving parts because of it's imparative nature.
    *     2. Again it depends on the modeling, if the model fits with iterative nature then obviously it fits.
    *     3. Plus point it can really be performant solution, again depends on modeling as well 
    *     4. Obvioudly depending on the situation and tech stack used we can decide which one to go for.
    * 
    * There is no direct yes/no answer though. As said already it depends on what underlying platform we are on
    * and what tooling is avilable (for example trempolining, tail call elemination, non recursive data model etc.)
